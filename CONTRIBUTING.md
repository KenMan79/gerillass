**Gerillass Style Guide**

* Indent with two spaces (not with tab)
* Use camelCase format for function names only and start with two underscore characters (e.g. `__remify`).

_The method I recommend for experimenting Gerillass is to use Gulpazan. It is a Gulp based workflow that I built for to create static pages easily. You can access it in my repositories._
