## Gerillass Style Guide

I Used Prettier to format the code.

* Indent with two spaces (not with tab)
* Use camelCase format for function names only and start with two underscore characters (e.g. `__remify`).

### Functions

All the functions must be in the **utilities** folder. The function names start with two underscores and follow camelCase naming convention (e.g. `__pseudoSelector()`).

In the entire library, only the function names are following the camelCase naming convention to make a strict distinction between the fucntions and the mixins. Rest of the code follows kebab-case (also known as spinal-case) naming convention.

### Mixins

The mixins should be placed in the **library** folder and they must follow the kebab-case naming convention.



_The method I recommend for experimenting Gerillass is to use Gulpazan. It is a Gulp based workflow that I built for to create static pages easily. You can access it in my repositories._
