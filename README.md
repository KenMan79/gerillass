# Gerillass

_The best Sass tool set ever for guerrilla type of CSS coders._

## What is Gerillass?

[Gerillass](https://gerillass.com) is a library built on top of [Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets)](https://sass-lang.com/) to give you flexibility for your projects and accelerate your performance and creativity.

Many of the utilities that come with Gerillass are the solutions I have come up with for the challenges I have faced as a frontend developer over the years. These solutions have been shaped by the inspiration of other popular libraries and frameworks like [Bourbon](https://www.bourbon.io/), [Susy](https://www.oddbird.net/), [Scut](https://davidtheclark.github.io/scut/), [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), etc. over time and helped me create Gerillass.

Hope youâ€™ll enjoy using it!
